Package: libopenalpr2
Section: libs
Architecture: amd64
Depends: libopenalpr-data (= ${source:Version}), ${shlibs:Depends},
 ${misc:Depends}
Description: Automated License Plate Recognition library (OpenALPR)
 OpenALPR is an open source Automatic License Plate Recognition library written
 in C++. The library analyzes images and identifies license plates. The output
 is the text representation of any license plate characters found in the image.

Package: libopenalpr-dev
Section: libdevel
Architecture: amd64
Depends: libopenalpr2 (= ${binary:Version}), ${misc:Depends}
Description: Development files for the OpenALPR library
 OpenALPR is an open source Automatic License Plate Recognition library written
 in C++. The library analyzes images and identifies license plates. The output
 is the text representation of any license plate characters found in the image.

Architecture: all
Depends: ${misc:Depends}
Description: Runtime data for the OpenALPR library
 OpenALPR is an open source Automatic License Plate Recognition library written
 in C++. The library analyzes images and identifies license plates. The output
 is the text representation of any license plate characters found in the image.

 adduser,
 beanstalkd
Description: Daemon to run OpenALPR in the background
 OpenALPR is an open source Automatic License Plate Recognition library written
 in C++. The library analyzes images and identifies license plates. The output
 is the text representation of any license plate characters found in the image.
 .
 The OpenALPR daemon allows you to monitor a camera stream for license plate
 numbers in the background. Alprd runs as a daemon process on Linux.
 .
 The plate numbers can be streamed to another server (via HTTP posts) or can be
 consumed programmatically via a beanstalkd queue.

Package: openalpr-utils
Section: utils
Architecture: amd64
Depends: libopenalpr2 (= ${binary:Version}), ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: Utilities for the OpenALPR library
 OpenALPR is an open source Automatic License Plate Recognition library written
 in C++. The library analyzes images and identifies license plates. The output
 is the text representation of any license plate characters found in the image.
 .
 The OpenALPR utils package contains a collection of binaries that help with 
 training new data.  The following binaries are included:
 .
 openalpr-utils-calibrate - Calibrates the software for cameras capturing plate
 images at an angle
 .
 openalpr-utils-benchmark - Benchmarks accuracy/speed against a testing dataset
 .
 openalpr-utils-tagplates - Utility to tag the location and plate number for 
 testing and training
 .
 openalpr-utils-classifychars - Extracts character images from cropped plate
 images for OCR training
 .
 openalpr-utils-prepcharsfortraining - Reformates character images into a format
 that Tesseract can use for OCR training
